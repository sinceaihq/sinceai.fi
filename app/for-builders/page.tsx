    question: "Is there a cost to join Since AI?",

    question: "What is the application process for Since AI Hackathon 2026?",
    answer:
      "Applications for Since AI Hackathon 2026 open on a rolling basis ahead of the event. Apply at sinceai.fi/hackathon. You can apply as an individual or as a pre-formed team. Team formation support is available at the event.",

    question: "Do I keep the IP from my work at Since AI events?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I apply to the hackathon as a team?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can apply as an individual or bring a pre-formed team of up to 5 members. Teams that form on-site during the event are also common — we run team formation sessions at the start of the hackathon.",
  },
  {
    question: "I'm a student — can I join Since AI?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Students are welcome and make up a significant part of the Since AI community. We work with university AI societies across Europe including Aalto AI, HankenAI, and others. No minimum experience level required — we care about what you build, not your CV.",
